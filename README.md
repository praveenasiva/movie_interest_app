# Movie Interest Prediction App

A simple web application that predicts a user's movie interest category (Animation, Action, or Drama) based on their age and gender, using a **Decision Tree Classifier**.

---

## Features

- Predicts movie interests based on user input (age and gender)  
- Clean and intuitive web interface  
- Built using Python and Flask  
- Uses a Decision Tree Classifier for predictions  

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie_interest_app.git
cd movie_interest_app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the model (optional)

A pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) is already included. If you want to retrain the model:

```
python train_model.py
```

---

## Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## How It Works

- The app uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** trained on sample data from `Movie_Interests.csv`.  
- When a user submits their age and gender:
- The model predicts a movie interest category.
- The app displays the predicted interest (Animation, Action, or Drama).

## Future Improvements

- Add more input features like location, favorite genre, etc.  
- Experiment with different machine learning models  
- Improve the UI using frontend frameworks
